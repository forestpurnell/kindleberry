## Kindleberry

This is an application that allows a jailbroken kindle to act as a wireless display. Inspired by Max Ogden's [project of the same name](https://maxogden.com/kindleberry-wireless.html), this uses the same code packaged for the [kindle unified launcher](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=203326.)

I aim to make this package and its server-side scripts into a pushbutton solution in the near future.
